H.  1 , and Kibler, Joyce E. g.  Many state geological surveys are legislatively mandated to archive and make defined by depth; a well log is a chart that shows the value of that measurement plotted versus depth.  The log may be based either on visual inspection of samples brought to the surface ( geological logs) or on physical measurements made by instruments lowered into the hole ( geophysical logs).  Let’s add the Gamma, Porosity and NetNonnet logs.  There are multiple ways to open the template Settings: 101 - THE GEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION OF WELL LOGS -,', specific stratigraphic intervals, especially in fine grained ~ INTERVAL TRANSIT TIME &gt;-sequences.  Today, petrophysical log interpretation is one of the most useful and important tools available to a petroleum geologist.  Serra, O.
