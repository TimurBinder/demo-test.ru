I ended up with -140 mV on the core and -60 mV for the cache.  Status Not open for further replies.  It works in a similar manner to the Windows program ThrottleStop (i. 12v to -0. 125) In the CPU core voltage window/offset voltage, the offset voltage stick on range 125ml and shows a value at 125mv. 024, round to the nearest integer, then shift left until you have only 11 bits of the original number.  Ok so I have dell g3 laptop with i7-10750h with speed 2. 125 offset I just dont care anymore, didnt even try to go lower because its already 50w less than stock 180w this cpu used.  Try using throttlestop to play with pl1 and pl2 instead All the newer Intel CPUs are power hungry monsters.  EfficientCaptain1876 • 8 mo.  Last edited: Sep 11, 2020.  Joined Oct 22, 2014 Messages Location Undervolting is playing the silicon lottery, identifying the minimum voltage the specific CPU needs (both from cold and hot boot) and then locking the voltage to the CPU to that level.  You can try making a voltage change in the bios like you did with your previous 11800H but this could brick your 12th Gen laptop. org docs.  Sebelum lanjut lebih jauh, pastikan Intel XTU sudah terinstall pada laptop kalian.  I can’t seem to find the option to simply set a cpu voltage offset value.

Currently set to adaptive voltage in the bios and tried using offset/ auto settings which didn't turn it off.  The 11th Gen CPUs reported that this feature was Locked which means it could be unlocked.  So an average cpu will still undervolt by -125mv and operate functionally But for 10th gen, to squeeze more performance, they had to raise the clocks without raising the voltage, otherwise it would be too hot and because 14nm++ is at the limit.  Ensure the latest BIOS patches are installed – with Undervolt Protection.  only if the INTEL TURBO BOOST TECHNOLOGY is enabled.  Basically, you slide the Core Voltage Offset bar to the left to decrease the CPU voltage (Undervolt) by 1 or 2 steps at a time. 2v.
