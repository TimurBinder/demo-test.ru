The switch uses 5 V, 35 mA thermal actuation for &lt; 500 mus to toggle between states and a compliant bistable latching mechanism to hold the state in the absence of applied bias.  7, no.  Bistable compliant elements offer excellent advantages in many applications ranging from high precision sensing to energy harvesting.  This model was then coupled with an optimization program, allowing extensive exploration of the design space.  Thingiverse is a universe of things.  This mechanism is designed to represent a constant force mechanism, which provides a constant force through a specific range of motion.  The flexible and resilient segment is ‚Ä¶ A compliant, bistable operating mechanism (10) has a plurality of coupled segments (14) including at least two rigid segments (22, 26, 30) and at least one relatively flexible, resilient segment (34).  The flexible, resilient segment is coupled to adjacent rigid segments either fixedly or ‚Ä¶ Just click on the icons, download the file (s) and print them on your 3D printer. 4 rad (23 &#176;) respectively.

I.  1089-1098. byu.  Later, they utilized the basic bistable structure and shape memory alloy to actuate an untethered, soft swimming robot [15].  A contact ‚Ä¶ In this paper, we present a 3D-printed compliant bistable gripper which is easy to close, stable to hold, and easy to adjust for a palm-size quadcopter to perch on cylindrical objects.
