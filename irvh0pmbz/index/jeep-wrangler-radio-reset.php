I took my 130 out years ago.  I have replaced my radio in my 2018 Wrangler three times and the fourth time rather than replace the radio, the service department replaced the media hub.  I have the 5.  Hold MUTE and TUNE buttons for reboot.  I parked the Jeep.  Hold down the enter and volume buttons for 15 to 25 seconds.  An hour later, I get in Jeep to drive to dealership.  ‘WAIT’.  Wiring issues can lead to poor or no sound quality, or no sound at all.  Test the touch screen to see if it’s now working.  Since the launch of this service, more than 5967 customers have already received their jeep radio unlocking code.   </span> </h3>
