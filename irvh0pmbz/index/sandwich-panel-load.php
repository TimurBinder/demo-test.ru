The same blast load simulations were carried out after filling the core completely with foam.  When degraded building floors need to be replaced, composite sandwich panels are a potentially interesting solution, namely for buildings with load-bearing rubble masonry walls.  It was concluded that the introduction of glass-fibre layers into carbon-fibre laminate skins reduces brittle failure compared to a sandwich panel with carbon-fibre reinforced Sheet metal is used as the outer layer of sandwich panels.  Similar to the trend of peak force, the sandwich panels with higher cores dissipate greater SEA when the other two parameters (core web thickness and corrugation angle) remain the same.  In the first region, a linear trend is observed with a small deformation.  [2].     </h3>
