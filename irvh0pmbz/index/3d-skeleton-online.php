If you're not skilled at design, here's some good news for you; you don't have to design the skeleton from scratch.  Recently, many researchers capture the correlation information of temporal and spatial dimensions in spatial-temporal graphs.  Complete Anatomy supports educators with online learning that seamlessly integrates with your teaching. CV] 23 Dec 2021.  Then, these four images are fed into a CNN-based Action Recognition Model for action recognition.  The concept of skeleton-based representation can be traced back to the early seminal research of Johansson (1973), which demonstrated that a small number of joint positions can effectively represent human behaviors.  62403 8187 59.  </span> </li>
