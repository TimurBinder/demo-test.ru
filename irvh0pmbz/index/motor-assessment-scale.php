The NOMAS (Neonatal Oral-Motor Assesment Scale) was developed in 1983 by Marjorie Meyer Palmer MA, CCC-SLP and has since become a reliable tool for the evaluation of neonatal sucking patterns in pre-term and term infants.  The reliability and validity studies of the original scale were performed in a group of healthy Canadian infants; 253 infants were assessed for test–retest and interrater reliabilities, and 120 infants were involved in the assessment of the concurrent validity with motor scales of the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales (PDSM) and the Bayley Alberta Infant Motor Scales (AIMS) The AIMS is an assessment scale designed to assess motor development in infants from birth until the attainment of independent walking (Piper, Pinnell, Darrah, Maguire, &amp; Byrne, 1992).
