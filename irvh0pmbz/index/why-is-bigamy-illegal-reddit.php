Polygamy is the practice or custom of having more than one wife or husband at the same time.  It shows that polygamy is permitted in countries predominantly in Africa and Asia, including Algeria, Mali, Niger, Saudi Arabia and Iran.  Only monogamous marriages are provided for in The Bigamy.  It is a criminal offence to marry a person whilst already married.  The words “bigamy” and “polygamy”—and their derivatives—are sometimes used interchangeably.  While the history behind polygamy and it being illegal is true, this explanation explains why it can't be championed as a movement similar to gay marriage.  To them and their indoctrination, polygamy was commanded by god and &quot;Joseph didn't want to do it&quot;.  The Crimes Act 1900 states: “ Whosoever, being married, marries another person during the life of the former spouse (including husband or wife), shall be liable to imprisonment for seven years ”.  P.  law.  </span> </li>
