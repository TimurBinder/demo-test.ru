Named Credential can't automatically refresh the token unless the service returns HTTP 401.  Soon, the authentication for that will need to use a Salesforce session id.  Secure storage of credentials.  Click New Named Credential, or click Edit to modify an existing named credential.  Named Credentials cannot be used to handle this authentication flow, but the feature can be leveraged to get the token without having to resort to something like Custom Settings for storing the username &amp; password.  </h3>
