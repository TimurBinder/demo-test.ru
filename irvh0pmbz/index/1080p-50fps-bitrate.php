This is why it‚Äôs important to get fast SD cards for the R6, and I‚Äôve put together a separate post on Canon R6 memory card recommendations.  Resolution: 640x360.  On the other hand, a video with less than 3000 kbps bitrate would be of very low quality, even if at 720p resolution or less.  However, with respect to audio quality, bitrate refers to the amount of audio bits transferred at a given time.  3840 x 2160.  That is to say, for 4K video file with 8-bit Bit Depth, the size of one frame is 8.  For Twitch streamers, adaptive bitrate encoding is available in Streamlabs Desktop.
