Assuming a 100A feeder breaker, use #8 copper.  It is thick enough to carry the current produced by the 80 amps service.  You can use a 4-gauge aluminum wire for 50 amps.  This is a good goal to shoot for when sizing the conductors for an underground cable.  You can put as many breakers in the panel as the panel will hold, you just can't concurrently use loads that will exceed 60A per 120v leg.  A circuit size is defined by the overcurrent protection not the of the equipment attached to it.  The 60A breaker feeding the 6/3 (I hope it's copper) will limit the current to the subpanel to 60A per 120v leg.  With older panels finding anything larger than is doubtful.
