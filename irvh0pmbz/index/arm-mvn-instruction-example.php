Instruction summary; Instruction width specifiers; Memory access instructions; General data processing instructions; MOV and MVN; MOV32 pseudo-instruction; MOVT; MRC, MRC2, … ADD r2,r2,#3 is exactly identical to ADD r2,#3 for assemblers that accept both.  &lt;Operand2&gt; is what ARM refers to as its flexible 2nd operand.  ARM is an example of a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) which was designed for easy instruction pipelining.  Also, as stated by daith, what you can do is : write a small assembly listing; save it; assemble it with a version of Sourceware AS that understands ARMv7 5. 3 Branch and Exchange (BX) 4-6 4.  ARM has 16 32-bit “general purpose” registers (r0, r1, r2, , r15), but some of these The ARM Instruction Set. , B instruction is encountered during an ongoing execution then the processor immediately switches to the provided address location and begins to execute the operation from that location.  This instruction permits forward and backward This site uses cookies to store information on your computer. 3 shows how the assembler generates code from the load immediate pseudo-instruction.  CMN makes the same comparison but with the second operand negated, i.  MVNNE r11, #0xF000000B ….  Implement (if --- then ---else) functionality using ARM instructions Example of using ‘BX’ instruction; ARM state codes CODE32 ; 32-bit instructions follow LDR r0,=tcode+1; address of tcode to r0, ; +1 Writing ARM and Thumb Assembly Language; Assembler Reference; ARM Instruction Reference; Thumb Instruction Reference MOV, MVN, and NEG.  Table 9 shows the range of 16-bit values that can be loaded in a single MOV ARM instruction in ARMv6T2 and later.  A32 and T32 instruction summary; Instruction width specifiers; Memory access instructions; General data processing instructions MOV and MVN; MOVT; MOV32 pseudo-instruction; MRC and MRRC; … A shorter response, just from someone that is more closer to your level, hope it helps: in ARM, instructions have 32bits.  Instruction summary; Instruction width specifiers; Memory access instructions; General data processing instructions; Flexible second operand … 16-bit instructions. The value of z flag will be 0 before execution of instruction.  The manual you're searching for is the ARM Architecture Reference Manual, which describes how the opcodes are formed in section 3.  The numerical values are -(n+1), where n is the value available in MOV.  Rd.  &lt;OP&gt; is replaced with the desired operation (ex.  This form … As we saw last time, if you’re writing assembly by hand, you can just write LDR Rd, =#nnn and the assembler will figure out which MOV, MVN, or (worst case) LDR … ARM Compiler armasm Reference Guide Version 6.  By disabling cookies, some features of the site will not work One possible reason is that the instruction is invalid because in a “flexible second operand” as required by MOV/MVN, an immediate value must be able to be expressed as an 8 bit pattern shifted by an even number of bits.  the carry flag. 17 Instruction Speed Summary 5-47 5 ARM … The 32-bit MVN instruction can load the bitwise complements of these values.  ARM has a “Load/Store” architecture since all instructions (other than the load and store instructions) must use register operands.  So if you … If it is in a register, then it produces an ORR instruction ( ORR &lt;Xd&gt;, XZR, &lt;Wm&gt; )*.  You cannot use PC or SP in any MVN{S Correct example.
