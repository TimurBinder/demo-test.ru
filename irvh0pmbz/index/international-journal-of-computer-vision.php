Segmentation as selective search for object recognition.  122–139, March 1983.  X.  In this paper we propose a variational model for the Retinex problem that unifies previous methods.  Deep learning techniques have emerged as a powerful strategy for learning feature representations directly from data and have led to … International Journal of Computer Graphics.  1992.  The proposed method is also a generalization of an active contour model without edges based 2-phase segmentation, developed by the authors earlier in T.  We describe how 3D affine measurements may be computed from a single perspective view of a scene given only minimal geometric information determined from the image.  The great success of deep learning is mainly due to its scalability to encode large-scale data and to maneuver billions of model parameters.  The somewhat small size … In this paper, we present Group Normalization (GN) as a simple alternative to BN.  Google Scholar We would like to show you a description here but the site won’t allow us.
