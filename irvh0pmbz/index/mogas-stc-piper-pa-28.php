<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mogas stc piper pa 28.  Here you’ll find the models covered by the current FAA STC.  STC SA1228CE approves the installation of new-style extended wingtips with recognition lights on the following Piper airplanes: PA-28-140, -150, -160 (all serial numbers)PA-28-180 (serial numbers 28-1 through 28-7205318).  • 2A13, Piper PA-28 • 3A19, Cessna 150 • E-295, Lycoming 0-540 • A7CE, Cessna 400 Series • 3A13, Cessna 182 • A7SO, Piper PA-34-200 • A11EA, Gulfstream American AA-1 • 1A6, Piper PA-22 • E-273, Continental 0-470 • P57GL, McCauley • P-920, Hartzell • 2A4, Twin Commander • E-284, Textron Lycoming • A9CE, Cessna 188 Listings under $1,500,000.  Lots of pro/con discussions on mogas use but I can't find the who and how much $$$ for an STC.  Range over 5 Hrs.  I have no plans for more hot fuel flight testing at this time.  Many different aircraft types and engines were now certified for using MOGAS legally and they saving money with every hour flighttime.  You can run regular 87 octane fuel through that thing and instead of paying $4 to $5 a gallon, we’re paying $2.  From Blakey to Brown, Como to Costa, Eckstine to Eldridge, Galbraith to Garner, Harris to Hines, Horne to Hyman, Jamal to Jefferson, Kelly to Klook; Mancini to Marmarosa, May to Mitchell, Negri to Nestico, Parlan to Ponder, Reed to Ruther, Strayhorn to Sullivan, Turk to Turrentine, Wade to Williams… the forthcoming publication Treasury of Pittsburgh Jazz … Also I forgot to mention, on these older engines you can get the MOGAS STC, so that cuts the expense of 14GPH 100LL to 14GPH MOGAS (in midwest it's $1/gal cheaper minimum), so you can save a couple bucks there.  Add the RAM 160 STC to your Penn Yan Aero overhaul and enjoy the benefits of 160 horsepower.

The Pa38 might have more problems if left in the sun due to its wing tanks.  This stripped-down version of the Warrior lacked the third window on each side, lacked baggage area and door, had pre-1978-style landing gear strut fairings (and no wheel or brake fairings), and had different instrument panels and paint schemes.
