Again, if you need vertex displacement we should copy the DepthOnlyVertex function into our code, rename it to vert, and add the displacement code like in the ShadowCaster example above.  It's a Samsung Galaxy A5 2017 running Android 8.  I am working on a custom render feature for the URP pipeline to render special shadows.  Light Maps and Probes.  In the Inspector for the URP asset, enable SRP Batcher.  I suspect that because SRP batcher in its underlying logic, abuses the use of the CBUFFER logic used by Instancing so much that they literally made it incompatible and yet there are many other rendering logic which is actually reliant on Instancing to work.  In this example, the shader colors the object green, even if the object is occluded (allowing the object to be seen through walls); and then the shader colors the visible portion of the object red.  To activate the SRP Batcher in either URP or HDRP: In the Hierarchy window, select the URP Asset or HDRP Asset. unity3d.  Using this in the Universal Render Pipeline (URP), High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) or a custom render pipeline based on the Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) will likely result in a drop in performance.
